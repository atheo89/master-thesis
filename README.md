# Machine learning data preparation for epileptic seizures prediction

Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects approximately 50 million people worldwide.
These intractable seizures postures are a serious risk of injury, restrict the self-suffciency and mobility
of a person. They also result in social isolation and have a severe financial impact on the individuals.
Prognosis of the above postures has been a research topic for the last 30 years.

A key task when you want to build an sophisticated analytic model using machine learning or deep
learning technique is the integration and preparation (data cleansing and feature engineering) of the
data sets. This step consists approximately 80 percent of the whole analytics project. In this thesis,
we focus on data preparation of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals in order to extract accurate
features and therefore predict epileptic seizures.

The data preparation is then applied on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database which was collected at the
Childrens Hospital Boston and is consisted of scalp Electroencephalogram recordings from pediatric
subjects with intractable seizures. In this database, all subjects were monitored for up to several days
following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication.

In conclusion, this thesis implements different combination of data preprocessing algorithms to generate
features for seizures prediction, which, in turn, can lead to substantial advances of neuroscience.
